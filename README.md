## Problem Statement

Email spam continues to flood inboxes, often carrying malicious or phishing content. During my internship at Oasis Infobyte, I developed a machine learning system to detect and filter spam emails effectively. The project focuses on preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and optimization to build a practical spam detection solution.

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared a dataset of emails for machine learning, including handling missing values and transforming text into model-ready features.  
2. **Feature Engineering:** Extracted meaningful features from emails, including sender, recipient, subject line, and email body, to improve model performance.  
3. **Model Selection:** Evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Multinomial Naive Bayes to identify the best-performing model.  
4. **Evaluation:** Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure robust performance.  
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimized model parameters to reduce false positives and improve predictive accuracy.  
6. **Cross-Validation:** Applied cross-validation and tested on unseen data to confirm generalization.  
7. **Deployment Considerations:** Explored integration of the spam detection model into email filtering systems.  
8. **Ethical Handling:** Ensured privacy and data security while processing email content.  
9. **Challenges and Future Work:** Addressed challenges like evasion techniques and suggested improvements for future iterations.

## Project Summary

I designed a machine learning pipeline to classify emails as **spam** or **ham**. The workflow included data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and validation.  

**Highlights:**

- Preprocessed a large email dataset and converted text into suitable numeric features.  
- Applied multiple machine learning algorithms and evaluated performance.  
- Achieved high accuracy and recall, especially with the Multinomial Naive Bayes model.  
- Validated the model rigorously to ensure it generalizes well on unseen data.  
- Explored practical deployment scenarios for real-world email filtering.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can effectively combat email spam. The key results include:

- Approximately 13.41% of emails were spam, 86.59% were ham.  
- Keywords like 'free', 'call', 'text', 'txt', and 'now' were strong spam indicators.  
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes** achieved **98.49% recall**, showing strong ability to detect spam accurately.  

Through this project, I developed hands-on skills in feature engineering, model building, and evaluation, while contributing to a safer email environment.
